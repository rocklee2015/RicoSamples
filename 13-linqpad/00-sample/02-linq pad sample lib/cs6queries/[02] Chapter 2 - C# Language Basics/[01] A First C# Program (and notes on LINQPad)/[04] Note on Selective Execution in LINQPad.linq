<Query Kind="Statements" />

// With LINQPad, you can highlight a selection of code and hit F5 to execute just those statements.
// Try it with the code below:

int x = 12 * 30;
Console.WriteLine (x);

int y = 12 * 50;
Console.WriteLine (y);

int z = 12 * 100;
Console.WriteLine (z);

// Now try selecting a portion of the code, and pressing Shift+Ctrl+C (clone).
// The selected code appears in a new query.
