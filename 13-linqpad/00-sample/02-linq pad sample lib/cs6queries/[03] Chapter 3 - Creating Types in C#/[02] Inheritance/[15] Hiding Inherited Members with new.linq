// A base class and a subclass may define identical members. This usually happens by accident:

static void Main()
{
	B b = new B();
	b.Counter.Dump();		// 2
	
	// Notice the non-virtual behavior in the code below:
	
	A referenceConvertedB = b;
	referenceConvertedB.Counter.Dump();		// 1	
}

public class A      { public int Counter = 1; }
public class B : A  { public int Counter = 2; }

// Occasionally, you want to hide a member deliberately, in which case you can apply the new  
// modifier to the member in the subclass, to avoid the compiler warning. The behavior is the same:

public class X      { public     int Counter = 1; }
public class Y : X  { public new int Counter = 2; }
